**Sygil** is a magic system that lets magic be the way it was meant to be - overpowered, creative, and **LIMITLESS**.

Sygils are power words that can be combined to cast spells. You'll get a set from your DM, like:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Water`, `Heavy`, `Wood`, `Hot`  
To cast a spell, choose any two Sygils and combine them using the verb "is":  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Wood is Water` - *The wooden door blocking your path turns into a puddle.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That is Wood` - *The guard you're pointing at morphs into a tree.*  
Once you cast a spell, you can't cast it again that day, though you can use the same Sygils for new spells.  

You can direct the general interpretation of your spell if it is ambiguous. `Hot is Heavy` could mean  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The hot cauldron in front of you becomes extremely heavy and punches a hole in the floor.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or: *The heat coming from the cauldron becomes heavier and more intense.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or: both!  
Your DM has final say on the outcome of spell and whether an interpretation is reasonable.

The power of your spells is **LIMITLESS**. Be careful how you use them.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Water is Hot` - *You decide to boil the entire ocean for fun. The resulting steam explosion instantly kills every creature on the planet (including you).*

At the end of each day you'll get an all new set of Sygils to replace your current ones.  
Don't be stingy with your spells! The more you cast the more your power will grow, granting you more Sygils and new abilities.

Now go show the world what magic can really do.
